# **1.7 Measurement & Decoherence**

Measurement and decoherence define how quantum systems interact with the classical world. While quantum systems can exist in superposition and entanglement when isolated, these delicate states tend to collapse when exposed to the environment or when actively measured. Understanding measurement and decoherence is essential for working with qubits, designing quantum algorithms, and engineering stable quantum hardware.

# 1. Measurement: The Collapse of the Quantum State

Measurement in quantum mechanics is fundamentally different from classical observation.
Before measurement, a quantum system exists in a superposition of states:

|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

When measured in the computational basis:

• Outcome 0 occurs with probability |α|²
• Outcome 1 occurs with probability |β|²
• After measurement, the state collapses to the observed result

The post-measurement state is not a superposition. It becomes:

|0⟩ if outcome 0 is obtained
|1⟩ if outcome 1 is obtained

This collapse is instantaneous and irreversible.

# 2. Projective Measurement Formalism

Measurement is represented mathematically using **projection operators**.

For a single qubit measured in the computational basis:

P₀ = |0⟩⟨0|
P₁ = |1⟩⟨1|

The probability of observing 0 is:

p(0) = ⟨ψ|P₀|ψ⟩ = |α|²

and similarly for 1.
After measurement with outcome 0:

|ψ_after⟩ = P₀|ψ⟩ / √p(0)

This formalism generalizes to multi-qubit systems and different measurement bases.

# 3. Measurement Changes the System

Unlike classical measurement, quantum measurement is **active**:

• It reduces a superposition to a basis state
• It destroys relative phase information
• It eliminates amplitudes of unobserved outcomes
• It entangles the system with the measurement apparatus

Once measured, the original quantum state cannot be recovered.
This property is central to quantum no-cloning and cryptographic security.

# 4. Measurement Basis

Although the computational basis {|0⟩, |1⟩} is standard, measurement can occur in any orthonormal basis.

Examples:

• X-basis: {|+⟩, |−⟩}
where
|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
|−⟩ = (|0⟩ − |1⟩)/√2

• Z-basis: standard computational basis
• Y-basis: {|i⟩, |−i⟩}

Quantum gates are often used to rotate the state into a desired basis before measurement.

# 5. Decoherence: Uncontrolled Measurement by the Environment

Decoherence occurs when the environment interacts with a quantum system, effectively measuring it and destroying its superposition or entanglement.

A qubit interacts with:

• thermal noise
• electromagnetic fields
• phonons and vibrations
• nearby atoms
• instrument imperfections

These interactions entangle the qubit with the environment, collapsing or degrading its state. Decoherence transforms quantum information into classical information that leaks into the surroundings.

Unlike controlled measurement, decoherence is:

• unintentional
• unpredictable
• undesirable
• the primary obstacle to building stable quantum computers

# 6. Types of Decoherence

### A. Amplitude Damping

Energy leaks from the system.

Example:
A qubit in |1⟩ relaxes to |0⟩ due to interaction with the environment.

### B. Phase Damping (Dephasing)

The relative phase between |0⟩ and |1⟩ is lost.

State:

α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

becomes

|α||0⟩ + |β||1⟩

The superposition loses coherence but populations remain.

### C. Bit-Flip and Phase-Flip Errors

Environmental noise can flip the state:

Bit-flip: |0⟩ ↔ |1⟩
Phase-flip: |1⟩ becomes −|1⟩

Phase flips are invisible in classical logic but destructive in quantum interference.

# 7. Coherence Time

Quantum hardware is characterized by:

• T₁ time: energy relaxation time (amplitude damping)
• T₂ time: phase coherence time (dephasing)

A qubit is only useful for quantum computation while it remains coherent.
Quantum operations must complete well within both T₁ and T₂ times.

Typical values:

• Superconducting qubits: T₁ and T₂ on the order of 50–200 microseconds
• Trapped ions: T₂ can reach seconds or more
• Photonic qubits: less susceptible to many forms of decoherence

---

# 8. Why Decoherence Is the Central Challenge in Quantum Computing

Decoherence:

• destroys superpositions
• breaks entangled states
• introduces random errors
• disrupts interference patterns
• limits circuit depth
• increases error rates during computation
• requires error correction mechanisms

Quantum error correction codes, fault tolerance, and error mitigation strategies all exist because of decoherence.

---

# 9. Entanglement and Measurement

Measurement of one qubit in an entangled pair collapses the entire joint state.

Example:
|Φ⁺⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)

If the first qubit is measured as 0:
The second qubit collapses to 0.

If measured as 1:
The second qubit collapses to 1.

Entanglement causes measurement effects to propagate across qubits, which is powerful for quantum information but also vulnerable to decoherence.

---

# 10. Summary

1. Measurement collapses quantum states to basis states, eliminating superpositions.
2. Measurement outcomes are probabilistic, determined by amplitude magnitudes.
3. Decoherence is uncontrolled interaction with the environment that destroys quantum information.
4. Amplitude damping and phase damping are major forms of decoherence.
5. Coherence times (T₁, T₂) limit usable computation time.
6. Entangled states are extremely sensitive to environmental disturbance.
7. Quantum error correction and fault tolerance exist to combat decoherence.
8. Maintaining isolation while enabling controlled operations is one of the central engineering challenges of quantum hardware.
