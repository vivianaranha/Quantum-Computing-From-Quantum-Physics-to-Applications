# **1.6 Quantum Entanglement**

Quantum entanglement is one of the most remarkable and non-intuitive features of quantum mechanics. It refers to a situation in which two or more quantum particles become linked so that their properties are correlated in ways that cannot be explained by classical physics. The key idea is that entangled particles **share a joint quantum state**, meaning that the state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others.

Entanglement is not simply a strong correlation.
It is a deeper, inherently quantum connection that persists even across large distances.
This feature is central to quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum cryptography.

# 1. The Definition of Entanglement

Two quantum systems are **entangled** when their combined state cannot be factored into separate states for each subsystem.

For a two-qubit system:

If the joint state |ψ⟩ can be written as:

|ψ⟩ = |ψ_A⟩ ⊗ |ψ_B⟩

then the qubits are **not** entangled.

If the joint state **cannot** be written in that form, the qubits **are** entangled.

Example of an entangled state:

|Φ⁺⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)

This state cannot be factored into a product of individual qubit states.

# 2. Classical Correlation vs Quantum Entanglement

Classical correlation example:

Put a red ball in one box and a blue ball in another.
If someone opens one box, they know what’s in the other.
But the colors were predetermined from the beginning.

Quantum entanglement example:

Two qubits prepared in |Φ⁺⟩ do not have definite individual states.
It is not that one is 0 and one is 1 and we simply don’t know which is which.

Instead:

Both qubits are in a **superposition of both being 0 and both being 1**.
Only when one is measured does it acquire a definite value, and the other immediately follows.

This is fundamentally different from classical uncertainty.

# 3. The Bell States: Standard Entangled States

There are four maximally entangled two-qubit states known as the **Bell states**:

|Φ⁺⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)
|Φ⁻⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ − |11⟩)
|Ψ⁺⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ + |10⟩)
|Ψ⁻⟩ = (1/√2)(|01⟩ − |10⟩)

In each case, the two qubits share a joint superposition and cannot be described independently.

# 4. Measurement of Entangled Particles

Consider |Φ⁺⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩).

If you measure the first qubit:

• There is a 50% chance it collapses to 0
• There is a 50% chance it collapses to 1

But once you measure it:

• If the first qubit collapses to 0, the second collapses to 0
• If the first qubit collapses to 1, the second collapses to 1

This correlation occurs regardless of physical separation.

Important clarification:

No information travels faster than light.
The correlation is not a communication channel.
It is simply a property of the joint quantum state.

# 5. Entanglement and Non-Locality

Einstein famously referred to entanglement as **“spooky action at a distance.”**
He believed that hidden variables must exist to explain the behavior.

Later, **Bell’s theorem (1964)** and subsequent experiments proved:

• No local hidden variable theory can reproduce all quantum predictions
• Entanglement correlations cannot be explained by classical physics
• Quantum mechanics is intrinsically non-local (in correlations, not in communication)

Modern experiments have closed major loopholes, confirming entanglement as a real physical phenomenon.

# 6. Creating Entanglement in Quantum Computers

Entanglement is routinely generated using quantum gates.

Example: Using a Hadamard gate followed by a CNOT:

Start with |00⟩
Apply H to the first qubit:

H|0⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)

State becomes:

(1/√2)(|00⟩ + |10⟩)

Apply CNOT (control = first qubit, target = second):

(1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)

This is the Bell state |Φ⁺⟩.

Nearly all quantum algorithms rely on creating such entangled states.

# 7. Entanglement in Multi-Qubit Systems

Entanglement is not merely pairwise.
In systems with 3 or more qubits, more complex forms exist.

Examples:

GHZ state: (1/√2)(|000⟩ + |111⟩)
W state: (1/√3)(|001⟩ + |010⟩ + |100⟩)

Different patterns of entanglement enable different computational and communication tasks.

# 8. Why Entanglement Matters for Quantum Computing

Entanglement is central to quantum advantage.

It enables:

1. **Massive correlated state spaces**
   Quantum algorithms exploit the structure of entangled states to encode global information.

2. **Quantum teleportation**
   Entanglement is used to transmit quantum states without moving particles.

3. **Superdense coding**
   One qubit can transmit two bits of classical information using entanglement.

4. **Error correction**
   Quantum error correcting codes rely on encoding logical qubits into entangled physical qubits.

5. **Speedups in algorithms**
   Entanglement allows quantum systems to explore computational spaces in ways classical systems cannot replicate.

6. **Measurement-based quantum computation**
   Entire computations can be performed by measuring entangled resource states.

Without entanglement, quantum computers would be equivalent to classical probabilistic computers.

# 9. Entanglement vs Mere Superposition

It is important to distinguish:

Superposition:
• A single particle being in multiple states at once
• Example: a|0⟩ + b|1⟩

Entanglement:
• Multiple particles sharing a joint state
• Example: (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)

Superposition affects a single system’s internal state.
Entanglement links systems in ways that produce correlations with no classical parallel.
