# **1.1 Classical vs Quantum Worlds — The Deep Dive**

Understanding quantum computing **begins with understanding why the world behaves differently at tiny scales**. The rules that govern everyday objects (cars, planets, baseballs) simply **stop working** when you shrink things down to atoms and subatomic particles. A new set of principles emerges — the rules of **quantum mechanics**.

Let’s break this down step-by-step.

---

# **Part 1 — What Is the “Classical World”?**

The *classical world* refers to the physics you already know intuitively:

* A ball is either **here** or **there**.
* A car has a specific **speed and direction**.
* A light switch is either **ON or OFF**.
* If you know enough information, you can **predict the future** of a system exactly.

Classical physics is *deterministic*.
If you throw a ball, and you know the force + angle, you can predict exactly where it will land.

### Classical Example 1: A Coin Flip

A coin flip *seems* random, but classical physics says:

> If you knew the exact force of your thumb, spin, air resistance, and angle,
> you could predict the outcome **every single time**.

The randomness is only because the system is too complex for humans, but not fundamentally random.

### Classical Example 2: Planetary Motion

Planets obey Newton’s laws.
Their trajectories are fully predictable.

### Classical Example 3: A Light Switch

It is either in:

* State 0 (OFF), or
* State 1 (ON).

There is no in-between state.
This also becomes the model for **classical bits**: 0 or 1.

---

# **Part 2 — The Quantum World: Where Intuition Breaks**

At the atomic and subatomic scale (electrons, photons, quarks), nature follows **different rules** — quantum rules.

The quantum world is:

* **Probabilistic (inherently random)**
* **Discontinuous**
* **Non-deterministic**
* **Non-local**
* **Context-dependent** (measurement affects reality)

Here are the core ways the quantum world differs.

---

# **Difference #1 — Objects Can Be in Multiple States at Once (Superposition)**

Classical:
A bit is either 0 **or** 1.

Quantum:
A qubit can be in a state that is **both 0 and 1 simultaneously**.

Not metaphorically.
Literally.

### Example: Spinning Coin vs Quantum Coin

* A spinning coin is not “heads and tails at the same time.”
  It is simply in motion, but physically it is exactly one state at every moment.

* A quantum coin *is* heads and tails at the same time **until you measure it**.

When you measure it, the superposition **collapses** to a definite outcome.

### Real-world quantum example: Electron in an atom

An electron doesn't orbit the nucleus like a tiny planet.
Instead, it exists as a **cloud of probabilities** — a distribution of where it *might* be found.

Until you measure it, it is not at a specific location.

---

# **Difference #2 — Quantum Objects Can Be Intrinsically Entangled**

**Entanglement** is a uniquely quantum phenomenon where two particles become linked such that:

* Changing one instantly influences the other
* Regardless of distance (1 foot away or 1 light-year away)

This breaks classical logic.

### Example: Gloves in Boxes (Classical Analogy)

If you put a left glove in one box and a right glove in another:

* Opening Box A tells you what's in Box B
* But nothing *changes* Box B
* The gloves had definite states all along

### Quantum Entanglement Example

Two entangled electrons have spins such that:

* They are not “one up, one down”
* They are in a shared **superposition** of all possibilities

When you measure one:

* Its state becomes definite
* The other particle’s state becomes definite **instantly**, even if they're miles apart

Einstein called this “spooky action at a distance.”

---

# **Difference #3 — Measurement Changes the System**

In classical physics:

* Measuring a car's speed does not change the car
* Observations do not “disturb” the system meaningfully

In quantum physics:

* Measuring a system *changes* the system
* Measurement forces a quantum state to “collapse”

### Example: Schrödinger's Cat

This famous thought experiment illustrates measurement collapse.

A cat is placed in a sealed box with a quantum-triggered mechanism:

* If atom decays → poison released → cat dies
* If no decay → cat lives

Before opening the box, quantum mechanics says the cat is in a **superposition of alive and dead**.

When you observe it, the quantum state collapses.

This is not because the act of observing magically changes the cat —
it's because quantum states do not have definite values until they are measured.

---

# **Difference #4 — Classical Paths vs Quantum Paths**

Classically:
A particle takes **one path** from A to B.

Quantum mechanically:
A particle explores **all possible paths simultaneously**.

This leads to:

* Interference
* Diffraction
* Quantum tunneling

### Example: Double-Slit Experiment

Shine light or electrons at two slits:

* If you don't observe which slit a particle goes through → interference patterns appear (wave-like behavior)
* If you observe which slit it goes through → interference disappears (particle-like behavior)

The act of measurement changes the outcome.

This experiment is the clearest demonstration that the quantum world is fundamentally non-classical.

---

# **Difference #5 — Quantum Tunneling**

Classical physics:
If a particle encounters a barrier higher than its energy, it **cannot** cross.

Quantum physics:
Particles can probabilistically “tunnel” through a barrier even if they classically shouldn't.

### Everyday Example:

Your phone's Flash memory works using quantum tunneling.
Electrons tunnel through a barrier to store charges in memory cells.

### Physical Example:

Stars shine because of tunneling.
In the Sun, protons must fuse — but classically, they don’t have enough energy to overcome the repulsion.
Quantum tunneling makes fusion possible.

---

# **Difference #6 — Probabilistic Outcomes Are Fundamental, Not Due to Ignorance**

Classical randomness = incomplete information
Quantum randomness = nature fundamentally probabilistic

### Example: Radioactive decay

There is no cause for *precisely when* an atom will decay.
It is inherently random — not due to hidden information.

---

# **Why Do These Differences Matter for Computing?**

Quantum mechanics offers:

* **Superposition → exponential state space**
* **Entanglement → powerful correlations between qubits**
* **Interference → cancel wrong answers, amplify correct ones**
* **Probabilistic measurement → new computational paradigms**

Classically, to represent 300 bits you need 300 binary states.
Quantumly, 300 qubits represent **2³⁰⁰ states simultaneously**, more than atoms in the universe.

This is why quantum computers can potentially solve certain problems exponentially faster.
