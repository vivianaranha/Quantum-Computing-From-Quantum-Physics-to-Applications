# **1.3 Probability Amplitudes & Complex Numbers**

In quantum mechanics, the fundamental mathematical object is not probability itself, but a **probability amplitude**. Probability amplitudes are complex numbers whose magnitudes determine the likelihood of outcomes, and whose phases determine how quantum states interfere with one another. This concept is essential for understanding qubits, superposition, interference, and quantum algorithms.

Classical probability uses real numbers between 0 and 1.
Quantum mechanics uses **complex-valued amplitudes**, which contain both magnitude and phase.
This richer structure allows phenomena that classical probability cannot reproduce, such as interference, reversibility, and superposition of states.

# 1. What Is a Probability Amplitude?

A probability amplitude is a complex number, often written as:

a = r e^{iθ}

where
r = magnitude (or absolute value)
θ = phase (or angle in the complex plane)

The **probability** of observing a particular outcome is:

P = |a|²

This rule is known as **Born’s rule**.

Thus:

• Amplitudes can be negative or complex
• Probabilities are always non-negative real numbers derived from amplitudes
• Phases influence how amplitudes combine, even though they do not directly appear in measurable probabilities

In quantum computing, the state of a qubit is written as:

|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

where α and β are complex-valued probability amplitudes satisfying:

|α|² + |β|² = 1

The amplitudes encode both the probability of outcomes and the phase relationships between them.

# 2. Why Complex Numbers?

Quantum mechanics fundamentally relies on **wave behavior**. Waves require descriptions that:

• allow oscillations
• allow phase information
• support superposition
• support interference
• allow unitary evolution (reversible rotations in Hilbert space)

Complex numbers are the most natural mathematical objects for these tasks. Real numbers alone cannot capture phase relationships, destructive interference, or the full symmetry of unitary transformations.

A classical probability distribution loses information when two possibilities cancel out. A quantum amplitude distribution **retains sign and phase information**, enabling destructive interference.

# 3. Amplitudes Determine Probabilities: The Born Rule

Suppose a qubit is in the state:

|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

If we measure the qubit in the computational basis:

• Probability of getting 0 is |α|²
• Probability of getting 1 is |β|²

For example:

If α = 1/√3 and β = √(2/3), both real:

|α|² = 1/3
|β|² = 2/3

These probabilities sum to 1.

If α or β were complex, for example:

α = i/√2
β = 1/√2

The probabilities remain:

|α|² = 1/2
|β|² = 1/2

because the magnitude of i is 1.

This demonstrates that amplitudes may be complex but probabilities remain real.

# 4. Phase and Interference

The **relative phase** between amplitudes matters greatly. Consider two states:

State A:
|ψ₁⟩ = (1/√2)|0⟩ + (1/√2)|1⟩

State B:
|ψ₂⟩ = (1/√2)|0⟩ – (1/√2)|1⟩

The only difference is the sign (phase of π radians) for |1⟩.

When interference occurs, such as in a sequence of gates or in algorithms like Grover’s, these phases determine which outcomes are enhanced and which are suppressed.

Example:
Apply a Hadamard gate to |ψ₂⟩.

H [(1/√2)|0⟩ – (1/√2)|1⟩]
= (1/2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) – (1/2)(|0⟩ – |1⟩)
= (1/2 – 1/2)|0⟩ + (1/2 + 1/2)|1⟩
= |1⟩

All amplitude on |1⟩; destructive interference eliminated |0⟩.
This type of cancellation cannot occur in classical probability theory.

Thus, phase carries crucial computational power.

# 5. Complex Numbers: The Algebra of Quantum States

A complex number z is written as:

z = x + iy

with
x = real part
y = imaginary part
i² = −1

Polar form expresses it as:

z = r e^{iθ}

where
r = √(x² + y²)
θ = arctangent(y / x)

In quantum mechanics:

• r determines amplitude magnitude (probability)
• θ determines phase (interference behavior)

Quantum gates act as linear transformations that rotate these amplitudes in complex vector spaces.

Example:
A global phase shift:

e^{iφ} |ψ⟩

does not change probabilities.
However, a relative phase shift:

|0⟩ + e^{iθ}|1⟩

changes interference patterns dramatically.

Complex algebra is not optional in quantum computing; it is the framework that encodes all quantum behavior.

# 6. Amplitude Vectors and Hilbert Space

The state of an n-qubit system is a vector in a complex vector space of dimension 2^n:

|ψ⟩ = Σ a_j |j⟩

where
j runs from 0 to 2^n – 1
a_j are complex amplitudes satisfying Σ |a_j|² = 1

This space is called Hilbert space.

Quantum computation is the manipulation of this amplitude vector via **unitary transformations**, which preserve total probability and reversibility.

---

# 7. Why Amplitudes Can Interfere

In classical probability:

If two events are mutually exclusive, their probabilities simply add.

In quantum mechanics:

Probability amplitudes interfere like waves.
Two paths can cancel or reinforce each other depending on phase.

Example: double-slit experiment.

Photons traveling through two paths:

Amplitude through slit 1: a₁
Amplitude through slit 2: a₂

Total amplitude at screen point x:

A(x) = a₁(x) + a₂(x)

Probability:

P(x) = |A(x)|²

Thus, even if |a₁|² and |a₂|² are small, their combination may be large or zero depending on the phase.

This is the core mechanism behind quantum speedup.

# 8. Negative and Complex Amplitudes Enable Quantum Algorithms

Consider a classical random walk: each step changes probabilities.
Consider a quantum walk: each step changes amplitudes, which can interfere destructively or constructively.

Quantum algorithms use this property to:

• cancel incorrect answer paths
• amplify correct answer paths
• bias probability distribution toward solutions

Grover’s algorithm is essentially an engineered interference process.

Shor’s algorithm uses interference to extract periodicity.

Quantum Fourier Transform manipulates phases to reveal hidden structure.

None of these are possible without complex probability amplitudes.

# 9. Summary of Key Points

1. Quantum systems are described by complex-valued amplitudes, not simple probabilities.
2. Probabilities are the squared magnitudes of amplitudes.
3. Complex phases determine interference patterns.
4. Measurement extracts classical probabilities by collapsing amplitudes.
5. Amplitude manipulation through unitary gates is the essence of quantum computation.
6. The use of complex numbers is not a mathematical convenience; it is required by the structure of quantum physics.
