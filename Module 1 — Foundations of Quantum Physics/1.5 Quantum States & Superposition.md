# **1.5 Quantum States & Superposition**

Quantum states describe everything that can be known about a quantum system. Unlike classical systems—which are defined by definite, measurable properties—quantum systems are represented by mathematical objects called **state vectors** that encode probabilities, amplitudes, and all possible outcomes of measurement.

Superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in a **combination of multiple possible states at once**, with the actual outcome revealed only when the system is measured.

These concepts form the foundation of quantum computing. Qubits, quantum gates, interference, entanglement, and measurement are all built on the idea of states and superpositions.

## 1. What Is a Quantum State?

A quantum state is a complete description of a quantum system. For a single qubit, the state is written in the form:

|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

where
|0⟩ and |1⟩ are basis states (similar to classical 0 and 1)
α and β are complex probability amplitudes
|α|² + |β|² = 1

The amplitudes α and β determine the probabilities:

• Probability of measuring 0 = |α|²
• Probability of measuring 1 = |β|²

A classical bit can only be in one of two states: 0 or 1.
A quantum bit can be in **any linear combination** of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

This linear combination is the core idea of superposition.

## 2. The Computational Basis

Quantum states are expressed using basis vectors:

|0⟩ = [1, 0]^T
|1⟩ = [0, 1]^T

Any qubit state is a vector in a two-dimensional complex vector space (Hilbert space). This structure allows reversible transformations and interference effects not possible with classical bits.

## 3. What Is Superposition?

Superposition means that a quantum system can occupy multiple basis states simultaneously, with amplitudes determining how much of the system is in each state.

A superposition is not:

• the system switching quickly between states
• partial occupancy of states
• an unknown classical state

It is a genuine quantum state representing simultaneous possibilities.

Example of a typical superposition:

|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)|0⟩ + (1/√2)|1⟩

This means the qubit is equally in both |0⟩ and |1⟩ until measured.

## 4. Superposition and Measurement

Measurement collapses a superposition into a definite basis state.

For |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩:

• The outcome is 0 with probability |α|²
• The outcome is 1 with probability |β|²
• After measurement, the state becomes either |0⟩ or |1⟩

Before measurement, the qubit is not in an unknown classical state. It **does not have** a definite value. Its value is defined only in terms of possibilities.

This measurement collapse is key to quantum manipulation and algorithm design.

## 5. The Role of Linear Combination

Quantum states obey the rules of linear algebra. Any valid state can be scaled, added, or transformed as long as normalization is preserved.

For example, if two possible states exist:

|ψ₁⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
|ψ₂⟩ = γ|0⟩ + δ|1⟩

The system can form new states by linear combinations:

c₁|ψ₁⟩ + c₂|ψ₂⟩

This property allows quantum computers to explore multiple computational paths simultaneously.

## 6. Visualizing Superposition: The Bloch Sphere

A single qubit state can be visualized as a point on the unit sphere known as the **Bloch sphere**.

A general qubit state is written as:

|ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩

where θ and φ define a point on the sphere.

Key points:

• |0⟩ is at the north pole
• |1⟩ is at the south pole
• Equal superpositions lie on the equator
• Phase relationships change the position around the sphere

This visualization helps explain quantum gates as rotations on the sphere.

## 7. Superposition in Multi-Qubit Systems

With more qubits, the state space grows exponentially. Two qubits have four basis states:

|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩

A general state is:

|ψ⟩ = a|00⟩ + b|01⟩ + c|10⟩ + d|11⟩

with a, b, c, d as complex amplitudes satisfying:

|a|² + |b|² + |c|² + |d|² = 1

Superposition across multiple qubits allows quantum computers to operate over **2^n** states simultaneously.

## 8. Physical Examples of Superposition

### Electron in a box

The electron can exist in a superposition of energy states, not just the lowest one.

### Photon polarization

A photon can be polarized horizontally (|H⟩), vertically (|V⟩), or in any superposition:

α|H⟩ + β|V⟩

### Path superposition

In a double-slit experiment, a photon can be in a superposition of “went through slit 1” and “went through slit 2.”

These are all real physical examples, not metaphors.

## 9. Why Superposition Matters for Quantum Computing

Superposition enables:

1. **Massive parallelism**
   A single n-qubit register represents amplitudes over 2^n states.

2. **Interference**
   Quantum algorithms steer amplitudes toward correct answers and cancel incorrect ones.

3. **Reversible computation**
   Because quantum states are vectors, operations preserve information (unitarity).

4. **Quantum speedups**
   Algorithms like Grover’s and Shor’s rely on superposition to explore solution spaces faster than classical approaches.

Superposition is the foundation of quantum computational power.
